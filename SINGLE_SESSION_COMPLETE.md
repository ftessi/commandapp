# Single-Session Architecture Complete

## Overview
The application has been fully migrated from a dual-session system (device + ticket) to a single-session architecture where each ticket has its own unique session. This eliminates the issue of duplicate orders and simplifies the user flow.

## What Changed

### 1. Session Architecture
**Before:** Device sessions + Ticket sessions (complex, orders appearing twice)
**After:** Ticket sessions only (one session per ticket)

**Key Changes:**
- Removed device session concept entirely
- Each ticket request creates a new session
- Session token stored in localStorage: `commandapp_ticket_session`
- Email sent immediately with QR code for session recovery

### 2. Files Modified

#### Core Services
- **`src/services/sessionService.ts`**
  - Completely rewritten for single-session model
  - Removed: `createDeviceSession()`, `getStoredTicketIds()`, `hasPaidTicket()`, `getSessionByToken()`
  - Added: `hasActiveSession()`, `restoreSessionFromToken()`
  - Simplified storage to single key

#### API Routes
- **`src/app/api/tickets/route.ts`**
  - Enhanced POST handler to send email immediately after ticket creation
  - Generates QR code and calls `sendTicketEmail()`
  - Email contains QR code image and session recovery link

#### Components
- **`src/components/LandingPage.tsx`**
  - Updated navigation based on session presence
  - New users: see "Tickets" + "Contact" buttons
  - Returning users: see "Tickets" + "Order" + "Contact" buttons
  - Button text changes: "Get Tickets" → "My Ticket" when session exists

- **`src/components/TicketsPage.tsx`**
  - **COMPLETELY REWRITTEN** for single-session view
  - Three views:
    1. **Form View** (no session): Request ticket with name/email
    2. **Success View** (after request): "Check Your Email" message
    3. **Ticket View** (with session): Display QR code, ticket info, Pay Now button

  - Features in Ticket View:
    - Large QR code (clickable to enlarge)
    - Ticket number and type
    - "Pay Now" button (links to `/payment`)
    - Expandable details section
    - Entry redeemed status

- **`src/context/ProductsDataContext.tsx`**
  - Removed device session initialization
  - Cleaned up unnecessary session logic

#### New Pages
- **`src/app/payment/page.tsx`** ✨ NEW
  - Static information page about payment methods
  - Lists accepted payment types: Cash, Card, Digital Wallets, Bank Transfer
  - Instructions on how payment works at venue
  - FAQ section
  - Links back to tickets page

#### Other Routes
- **`src/app/session/[token]/page.tsx`**
  - Updated to use `restoreSessionFromToken()`
  - Redirects to `/tickets` after recovery

### 3. User Flow

#### New User (No Session)
1. Lands on homepage → sees "Tickets" + "Contact" buttons
2. Clicks "Get Tickets" → goes to `/tickets`
3. Fills form (name, email, selects ticket type)
4. Submits → creates session → API creates ticket → sends email
5. Sees "Check Your Email" success message
6. Clicks email link → session restored → redirected to ticket view

#### Returning User (Has Session)
1. Lands on homepage → sees "My Ticket" + "Order" + "Contact" buttons
2. Clicks "My Ticket" → goes to `/tickets`
3. Sees their ticket with:
   - QR code (clickable to enlarge)
   - Ticket number
   - Payment status (Pay Now button if pending)
   - Expandable details
4. Can click "Pay Now" → goes to `/payment` → sees payment info
5. Can click "Order" from home → places orders tied to their session

#### Email Recovery
- Email contains:
  - QR code image (embedded as data URL)
  - Session token link: `https://yourdomain.com/session/{token}`
  - Ticket details (name, type, price)
  - Instructions to click link to access ticket

### 4. localStorage Keys
- **Removed:** `commandapp_device_session`, `commandapp_ticket_sessions`
- **Active:** `commandapp_ticket_session` (single token string)

### 5. Session Token Usage
- **Ticket Creation:** Session created → token sent to API → linked to ticket
- **Order Creation:** Session token required → orders filtered by session
- **Order History:** Only shows orders for current session
- **Email Links:** Recovery links use session token

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] See ticket page with QR code and details
- [ ] Homepage now shows "Order" button

### 2. Session Persistence
- [ ] Refresh page → session persists
- [ ] Close and reopen browser → session persists
- [ ] Clear localStorage → session lost, back to form view

### 3. Payment Flow

- [ ] Orders tied to session token
- [ ] Order history only shows current session's orders

### 5. Email Functionality

- [ ] Can close modal by clicking outside or close button
- [ ] QR code URL: `/qr/{session_token}`

## Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Database Schema (No Changes Required)
The existing database schema already supports this architecture:
- `sessions` table: stores session tokens with user info
- `tickets` table: linked to sessions via `session_token`
- `orders` table: linked to sessions via `session_token`

## Benefits of New Architecture

### For Users
✅ Simpler experience (one session = one ticket = one identity)
✅ Immediate email with QR code
✅ Easy session recovery via email link
✅ Clear payment status and instructions
✅ No confusion about multiple tickets/sessions

### For Developers
✅ Single source of truth for sessions
✅ Cleaner code (removed dual-session complexity)
✅ Easier to debug and maintain
✅ No duplicate order issues
✅ Consistent localStorage usage

### For Business
✅ One ticket per person (proper tracking)
✅ Clear payment workflow
✅ Professional email confirmations
✅ Reduced support inquiries
✅ Better analytics (one session = one user)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Short Term
- Add payment status update API endpoint
- Implement QR code scanning at venue
- Add ticket transfer functionality
- Create admin panel for payment confirmation

### Long Term
- Add online payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
- Implement ticket cancellation/refunds
- Add event-specific ticket types
- Create multi-event support
- Add push notifications for payment confirmation

## Deployment Notes
1. Ensure all environment variables are set
2. Test email sending in production (Resend API)
3. Verify QR code generation works
4. Test session recovery links
5. Clear any cached localStorage in browsers
6. Update documentation for users
