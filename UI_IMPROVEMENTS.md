# 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Complete

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Ticket Number Showing "N/A" ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** The Resume component was trying to access `placedOrder.ticket_number` (snake_case) but the context returns `ticketNumber` (camelCase).

**Solution:** Updated Resume.tsx to check both formats:
```tsx
{placedOrder.ticketNumber || placedOrder.ticket_number || 'N/A'}
```

**Also Added:** Console logging to debug the order placement flow:
- Logs when order is placed
- Logs the ticket number received
- Logs when displaying the confirmation
