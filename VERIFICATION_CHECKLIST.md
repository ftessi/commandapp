# ✅ Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that your Next.js app is working correctly with identical styling to the React app.

## 1. Visual Styling Checks

Start the app (`npm run dev`) and verify:

### General Layout
- [ ] Dark background (#282c34) covers entire page
- [ ] Text is white on dark background
- [ ] Poppins font is used throughout
- [ ] Links have no underline and inherit color

### Navbar
- [ ] Navbar is visible at top
- [ ] Navigation items are properly styled
- [ ] Bootstrap styling is applied

### Product Menu
- [ ] Products are displayed in grid layout (Bootstrap columns)
- [ ] Product cards have proper spacing
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Prices are formatted correctly
- [ ] Add to cart buttons work
- [ ] Material icons display correctly

### Cart Bar
- [ ] Cart bar shows at bottom
- [ ] Total updates when adding/removing items
- [ ] Bootstrap button styles applied
- [ ] Quantity controls work

### Resume View
- [ ] Order summary displays correctly
- [ ] Items listed with proper styling
- [ ] Buttons use Bootstrap classes (btn, btn-primary, btn-outline-primary)
- [ ] Confirm order modal appears on click

### Order History
- [ ] Orders display in cards
- [ ] Status badges are styled correctly
- [ ] Order details are readable

## 2. Functionality Checks

### Cart Operations
- [ ] Add product to cart - updates quantity
- [ ] Remove product from cart - clears quantity
- [ ] Update quantity - reflects immediately
- [ ] Cart total calculates correctly
- [ ] Cart persists on page reload (localStorage)

### Order Placement
- [ ] Navigate to Resume view
- [ ] Confirm order with items in cart
- [ ] Order appears in "Current Orders" section
- [ ] Cart clears after order placement
- [ ] Toast/notification appears (if implemented)

### Order History
- [ ] Navigate to Order History view
- [ ] Current orders display
- [ ] Past orders display (if any)
- [ ] Can view order details

## 3. API/Serverless Function Checks

Run the test script:
```bash
npm run test-order-flow
```

Verify all tests pass:
- [ ] ✅ Health check
- [ ] ✅ Fetch products from /api/products
- [ ] ✅ Create order via POST /api/orders
- [ ] ✅ Fetch order by ID
- [ ] ✅ Update order status
- [ ] ✅ List all orders

### Manual API Tests

Open browser DevTools Network tab and verify:

**Load Products:**
- [ ] GET request to `/api/products` succeeds (200)
- [ ] Response contains products grouped by category
- [ ] Products have id, name, price, image, details

**Place Order:**
- [ ] POST request to `/api/orders` succeeds (201)
- [ ] Request includes total, status, items array
- [ ] Response includes order data with order_id

**View Order History:**
- [ ] GET request to `/api/orders` succeeds (200)
- [ ] Response includes array of orders

## 4. Environment Configuration Checks

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `.env.local` file exists in nextjs-app folder
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is set correctly
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set correctly
- [ ] No "Supabase URL not set" warnings in console

### Supabase Connection
- [ ] Products load from Supabase (not just fallback JSON)
- [ ] Orders save to Supabase database
- [ ] No authentication errors in console
- [ ] RLS policies allow operations

## 5. Styling Comparison

Open both apps side-by-side:
- **React app**: http://localhost:3000 (or your React port)
- **Next.js app**: http://localhost:3000

### Visual Comparison Checklist
- [ ] Background colors match
- [ ] Font family matches (Poppins)
- [ ] Font sizes are similar
- [ ] Spacing/padding matches
- [ ] Button styles match
- [ ] Card layouts match
- [ ] Grid layouts match (col-md-6, col-lg-4, etc.)
- [ ] Icons match (Material Symbols)
- [ ] Colors match throughout

## 6. Build & Production Checks

### Local Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] App runs in production mode
- [ ] All functionality works in production build

### Bundle Size (Optional)
- [ ] Check `.next/analyze` or build output
- [ ] First load JS is reasonable (<300KB typically)
- [ ] Images are optimized

## 7. Deployment Readiness

- [ ] `vercel.json` exists
- [ ] `.env.local.example` documents required variables
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide is available
- [ ] API routes use proper Next.js patterns
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs in code
- [ ] Environment variables use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client

## 8. Documentation Checks

- [ ] `README.md` is comprehensive
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT.md` has deployment instructions
- [ ] `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` explains changes
- [ ] `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` confirms migration
- [ ] `.env.local.example` documents environment setup

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Styles not loading
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for Bootstrap loading errors
- Verify layout.tsx has Bootstrap CDN links

### Issue: API routes return 404
**Solution:**
- Verify API route files are in `src/app/api/`
- Check file exports use proper Next.js route handlers (GET, POST, etc.)
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Solution:**
- Ensure `.env.local` is in the root of nextjs-app folder
- Restart dev server after changing env vars
- Verify variable names use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

### Issue: Supabase connection fails
**Solution:**
- Check Supabase URL and key are correct
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check Supabase dashboard for connection errors

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
- Verify all imports are correct

## ✅ Verification Complete!

If all checks pass, your Next.js app is:
- ✅ Styled identically to React app
- ✅ Fully functional with serverless API routes
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Commit your changes** to version control
2. **Deploy to Vercel** (or hosting of choice)
3. **Set environment variables** on hosting platform
4. **Test production deployment**
5. **Share with users!**
