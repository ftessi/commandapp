# Visitor Counter & Admin Login Update

## Summary
Successfully implemented a visitor tracking system and removed exposed credentials from the admin login page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/create_visitor_tracking.sql`
- Created `visitors` table to track all app visitors
- Stores visitor timestamp, user agent, and IP address
- Includes Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexed on `visited_at` for faster queries

### 2. API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/visitors/route.ts`
- **GET**: Retrieves visitor statistics (total, today, this week)
- **POST**: Records a new visitor with user agent and IP address
- Handles errors gracefully with proper logging

### 3. Landing Page Tracking
**File:** `src/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- Automatically tracks visitors when they land on the home page
- Calls the visitor API on component mount
- Non-blocking - doesn't interfere with user experience

### 4. Admin Dashboard Display
**File:** `src/app/admin/tickets/page.tsx`
- Added visitor statistics display in the header
- Shows three metrics:
  - üëÅÔ∏è **Total Visitors**: All-time visitor count
  - üìÖ **Today**: Visitors today
  - üìä **This Week**: Visitors in the last 7 days
- Stats are fetched on page load
- Formatted with colors for easy reading

### 5. Security Update
**File:** `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- Removed the default credentials display section
- No longer shows usernames and passwords publicly
- Login functionality remains unchanged

## How to Use

### Run the Migration
To enable visitor tracking, run the migration in your Supabase instance:
```sql
-- Execute the SQL file in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Or run: supabase migration up
```

### View Visitor Stats
1. Log in to the admin panel
2. Navigate to **Tickets Admin** (`/admin/tickets`)
3. Visitor statistics are displayed at the top of the page

### How Tracking Works
- Every time someone visits the home page, a record is created
- Tracks basic information (timestamp, user agent, IP)
- Stats update in real-time when viewing the admin dashboard

## Security Notes
- RLS policies ensure only authenticated users can read visitor data
- Public POST is allowed for tracking (anonymous visits)
- Admin credentials are no longer visible on the login page
- Consider implementing proper authentication in production

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add visitor tracking to other pages if needed
- Implement IP-based duplicate detection (same visitor within X hours)
- Add charts/graphs for visitor trends
- Export visitor data to CSV
