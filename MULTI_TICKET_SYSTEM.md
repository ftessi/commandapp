# Multi-Ticket Device Session System

## Overview
This system allows one device to purchase multiple tickets for different users while maintaining a permanent device session. Each ticket gets its own session for QR validation, but the device tracks all purchases locally.

## Architecture Changes

### Previous System (Single Session)
- ‚ùå One session per device
- ‚ùå Session updated when ticket purchased
- ‚ùå New users saw all orders

### New System (Device + Ticket Sessions)
- ‚úÖ **Device Session**: Permanent, tied to the device (orders)
- ‚úÖ **Ticket Sessions**: One per ticket purchased (entry validation)
- ‚úÖ **Local Storage**: Device tracks all ticket IDs
- ‚úÖ **Store Access**: Requires at least one paid ticket

## How It Works

### 1. Device Session (Permanent)
```typescript
// localStorage key: 'commandapp_device_session'
// Created on first app load
// NEVER changes, tracks orders for this device
```

**Purpose**: Track which orders belong to this device

### 2. Ticket Sessions (Per Ticket)
```typescript
// Created when purchasing each ticket
// One session per ticket, even if same device
// Used for QR validation and entry redemption
```

**Purpose**: Each ticket has unique QR for entry

### 3. Local Ticket Storage
```typescript
// localStorage key: 'commandapp_ticket_ids'
// Array of ticket IDs: ['uuid1', 'uuid2', 'uuid3']

// Individual tickets stored as:
// localStorage key: 'ticket_{ticket_id}'
{
  ticket_id: string,
  session_token: string,  // Unique per ticket
  first_name: string,
  last_name: string,
  email: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'redeemed',
  qr_data_url?: string,
  created_at: string
}
```

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Person Buys Ticket for Self
```
1. Opens app ‚Üí Device session created
2. Goes to /tickets
3. Fills form with their info
4. Clicks "Reserve Ticket"
   ‚Üí New ticket session created (session A)
   ‚Üí Ticket linked to session A
   ‚Üí Ticket stored in device localStorage
5. Admin marks as paid
6. User sees ticket in "My Tickets" section
7. User clicks "Show QR Code"
8. QR scanned at entrance ‚Üí Entry redeemed
```

### Flow 2: Person Buys Tickets for Friends
```
1. Opens app ‚Üí Device session created
2. Goes to /tickets
3. Fills form with Friend 1's info
4. Clicks "Reserve Ticket"
   ‚Üí New ticket session created (session B)
   ‚Üí Ticket stored in device localStorage
5. Sees success message, clicks "Purchase Another Ticket"
6. Fills form with Friend 2's info
7. Clicks "Reserve Ticket"
   ‚Üí New ticket session created (session C)
   ‚Üí Ticket stored in device localStorage
8. Now device has 2 tickets in "My Tickets"
9. Admin marks both as paid
10. Device shows both QR codes
11. Friend 1 scans QR with session B token
12. Friend 2 scans QR with session C token
```

### Flow 3: Store Access Validation
```
1. User opens app without tickets
   ‚Üí Store button shows "üîí Order (Ticket Required)"
   ‚Üí Button disabled with message
2. User purchases ticket
   ‚Üí Ticket in localStorage with status='pending'
   ‚Üí Store still locked (pending payment)
3. Admin marks ticket as paid
   ‚Üí User refreshes tickets page
   ‚Üí Ticket status updates to 'paid'
4. User returns to homepage
   ‚Üí Store button enabled "üç∫ Order"
   ‚Üí Can now access store
```

## localStorage Keys

### Device Level
```javascript
// Device session (permanent)
'commandapp_device_session' = 'uuid-device-session-token'

// List of all ticket IDs purchased from this device
'commandapp_ticket_ids' = '["ticket-id-1", "ticket-id-2", "ticket-id-3"]'

// Orders tracked by device session
'commandapp_current_orders' = '[...]'
'commandapp_past_orders' = '[...]'
'commandapp_cart' = '[...]'
```

### Ticket Level
```javascript
// Individual ticket sessions
'ticket_uuid-1' = '{
  ticket_id: "uuid-1",
  session_token: "session-token-for-user-1",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  status: "paid",
  created_at: "2025-10-26T..."
}'

'ticket_uuid-2' = '{
  ticket_id: "uuid-2",
  session_token: "session-token-for-user-2",
  first_name: "Jane",
  last_name: "Smith",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  status: "pending",
  created_at: "2025-10-26T..."
}'
```

## API Changes

### Session Creation Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/sessions

// Device session (on app load)
Body: { anonymous: true, device: true }
Response: { session: { session_token: "uuid-device" } }

// Ticket session (on ticket purchase)
Body: {
  anonymous: false,
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com"
}
Response: { session: { session_token: "uuid-ticket-specific" } }
```

### Ticket Creation
```typescript
POST /api/tickets
Body: {
  ticketTypeId: 1,
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  sessionToken: "uuid-ticket-specific"  // NOT device session!
}
```

## UI Components

### TicketsPage (`/tickets`)
**Sections:**
1. **My Tickets** (top)
   - Shows all tickets purchased from this device
   - Displays: Name, Email, Status badge, Created date
   - Actions:
     - "Show QR Code" button (if paid/redeemed)
     - "Open QR Link" button (if paid/redeemed)
     - "Refresh Status" button (fetch latest from API)

2. **Purchase Ticket** (bottom)
   - Ticket type selection
   - User info form (firstName, lastName, email)
   - "Reserve Ticket" button
   - Success message after purchase

### LandingPage (`/`)
**Store Button Logic:**
```typescript
if (checking) {
  // Show loading spinner
} else if (hasPaidTicket()) {
  // Show enabled "Order" button
} else {
  // Show disabled "Order (Ticket Required)" button
  // Display helper text: "Get a ticket first"
}
```

### QR Code Modal
- Displayed when clicking "Show QR Code"
- Generated on-demand via API: `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/`
- QR Data: `https://yourapp.com/qr/{session_token}`
- Actions:
  - "Open in New Tab" ‚Üí Opens `/qr/{token}` page
  - "Close" ‚Üí Dismisses modal

## sessionService.ts Functions

### New Functions
```typescript
// Device session management
getStoredSessionToken(): string | null
storeSessionToken(token: string): void
createDeviceSession(): Promise<Session | null>

// Ticket session management
createTicketSession(firstName, lastName, email): Promise<Session | null>
storeTicketSession(ticket: TicketSession): void
updateTicketSession(ticketId: string, updates: Partial<TicketSession>): void

// Ticket tracking
getStoredTicketIds(): string[]
addTicketId(ticketId: string): void
getStoredTicketSessions(): TicketSession[]

// Access validation
hasPaidTicket(): boolean
```

## Security Considerations

### Why Separate Sessions?
1. **Privacy**: Each ticket owner has unique QR
2. **Tracking**: Admin knows exactly who entered
3. **Flexibility**: Friends can share QR independently
4. **Audit Trail**: Each entry redemption tracked separately

### Why Device Session?
1. **Orders**: Device tracks its own orders (bar purchases)
2. **Persistence**: If app closed, orders remain
3. **Separation**: Orders ‚â† Tickets (different systems)

### Store Access Control
- **Without ticket**: User can browse but can't order
- **With pending ticket**: Store still locked (payment pending)
- **With paid ticket**: Full store access
- **After entry redeemed**: Store still accessible (can order drinks inside)

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Device Session Creation
- [ ] Open app first time
- [ ] Check localStorage has `commandapp_device_session`
- [ ] Refresh page ‚Üí Same device token persists

### 2. Single Ticket Purchase
- [ ] Go to /tickets
- [ ] Fill form with User A info
- [ ] Submit ‚Üí Check localStorage has `ticket_{id}` and ticket in array
- [ ] Check "My Tickets" section shows 1 ticket with "Pending" status

### 3. Multiple Ticket Purchase
- [ ] Purchase ticket for User A
- [ ] Click "Purchase Another Ticket"
- [ ] Fill form with User B info
- [ ] Submit ‚Üí Check localStorage has 2 different tickets
- [ ] Check "My Tickets" section shows 2 tickets

### 4. Payment Status Update
- [ ] Admin marks ticket as paid
- [ ] Return to /tickets
- [ ] Click "Refresh Status"
- [ ] Check ticket badge changes to "‚úì Paid"
- [ ] Check "Show QR Code" button appears

### 5. QR Code Display
- [ ] Click "Show QR Code" on paid ticket
- [ ] Modal opens with QR image
- [ ] QR contains correct URL: `/qr/{session_token}`
- [ ] Click "Open in New Tab" ‚Üí Opens QR page

### 6. Store Access
- [ ] Fresh device (no tickets) ‚Üí Store button disabled
- [ ] Purchase ticket (pending) ‚Üí Store still disabled
- [ ] Ticket marked as paid ‚Üí Store button enabled
- [ ] Can access /order page and make purchases

### 7. Entry Redemption
- [ ] Admin scans QR code
- [ ] Ticket marked as redeemed
- [ ] Refresh tickets page ‚Üí Status shows "‚úì Redeemed"
- [ ] Store access still works (can order drinks inside)

## Temporary Workaround (No Email)

Since email verification is pending, this system works entirely with localStorage:

1. **Ticket Purchase**: Stores ticket data locally
2. **QR Generation**: API generates QR on-demand
3. **Status Updates**: Manual refresh via "Refresh Status" button
4. **No Email**: QR codes displayed directly in app

**When Email Works Later:**
- Add email sending when ticket marked as paid
- QR code sent automatically via email
- Local storage still tracks everything as backup

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (When Email Ready)
- [ ] Send QR code email when ticket marked as paid
- [ ] Email includes ticket details and QR image
- [ ] Email has recovery link: `/qr/{token}`

### Priority 2
- [ ] Ticket transfer between devices
- [ ] Session sync across devices for same user
- [ ] Offline mode with sync when back online

### Priority 3
- [ ] Push notifications for ticket status changes
- [ ] In-app QR scanner for user-to-user sharing
- [ ] Analytics: Track which device bought most tickets

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Store button won't enable
**Solution:**
1. Check localStorage: `commandapp_ticket_ids`
2. Check each ticket status
3. At least one must have `status: 'paid'` or `status: 'redeemed'`
4. Try refreshing ticket statuses

### Issue: Tickets not showing in "My Tickets"
**Solution:**
1. Check localStorage: `commandapp_ticket_ids` array exists
2. Check individual ticket keys: `ticket_{id}`
3. Try purchasing new ticket to repopulate

### Issue: QR code not generating
**Solution:**
1. Check ticket has `session_token` field
2. Verify external API: `https://api.qrserver.com/` is accessible
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try "Open QR Link" button instead

### Issue: Wrong person's ticket shown
**Solution:**
- Each ticket is independent
- Check `first_name`, `last_name`, `email` fields in localStorage
- Device tracks all tickets purchased from it
- This is expected behavior (not a bug)

## Files Modified

### Core Session Logic
- `src/services/sessionService.ts` - Device + ticket session functions
- `src/context/ProductsDataContext.tsx` - Device session initialization

### UI Components
- `src/components/TicketsPage.tsx` - Multi-ticket display + QR modal
- `src/components/LandingPage.tsx` - Store access validation

### API (No changes needed)
- Existing `/api/sessions` handles both device and ticket sessions
- Existing `/api/tickets` works with any session token

## Summary

This system solves the multi-ticket problem by:
1. **Device session** = Orders (bar purchases)
2. **Ticket sessions** = Entry validation (QR codes)
3. **Local storage** = Device tracks all tickets purchased
4. **Access control** = Store requires paid ticket
5. **Flexibility** = Buy tickets for friends, each gets unique QR

The device is the "purchaser" but each ticket is for a specific person with their own QR code for entry.
